Project description: We will analyze information on pollution levels in the United States and try to find its main drivers: population, motor vehicles, industrial clusters, etc. We will then attempt to predict which cities will have the most relevant increases and decreases in the following years. 

Questions to be answered: 
•	Which areas/cities are the most polluted in the US?
•	Which factors affect pollution? Population, economic activities, cars, fires, etc. 
•	What are the main types of pollutants?
•	Is there seasonality for pollution?

Dataset to be used:
•	US Pollution Data: https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution
•	US Census
•	US Wildfire Database: https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires

Breakdown of Tasks: 
•	Gather data on pollution, and on the factors that we consider relevant. 
•	Comparison and statistical analysis of the information. 
•	Clean and adjust information. 
•	Answer questions and present results.
